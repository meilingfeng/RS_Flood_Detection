# Getting Started with NASA's CMR-STAC API in R

## Objective  

NASA's Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) archives and distributes cloud-native products in the LP DAAC Cumulus cloud archive. The primary objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to navigate through NASA’s Common Metadata Repository (CMR) SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC).  

This tutorial will help you to learn how to navigate the CMR-STAC API to discover NASA's cloud assets stored in the NASA Earthdata Cloud (Cumulus) and how to perform spatiotemporal queries for LP DAAC cloud-native products using R.  


## Tutorial  

- [CMR_STAC_Tutorial](https://git.earthdata.nasa.gov/projects/LPDUR/repos/hls_tutorial_r/browse/CMR_STAC_Tutorial.html?at=refs%2Fheads%2Fmain) shows how to navigate and explore CMR-STAC. 


## Setup  

### Prerequisites  

- Install R and RStudio. Details can be found [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). These tutorials have been tested on Windows using R Version 4.1.0 and RStudio version 1.4.1717.  

### Get started  

1. [Clone](ssh://git@git.earthdata.nasa.gov:7999/lpdur/data-discovery---cmr-stac-api.git) or [download](https://git.earthdata.nasa.gov/rest/api/latest/projects/LPDUR/repos/data-discovery---cmr-stac-api/archive?format=zip) Data Discovery - CMR STAC API repository from the LP DAAC Data User Resources Repository.  
2. Open the `CMR_STAC_Tutorial.Rproj` file to directly open the project. Next, open the R Markdown file (CMR_STAC_Tutorial.Rmd) from the `Scripts` folder.
